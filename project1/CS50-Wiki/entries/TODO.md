# Wiki Check List

Here I created a check list markdown for my wiki project. This check list will list out all of the following steps taken to complete my project.

- [X] Create a virtual environment for my project.
- [X] Create view for **`creating`**, **`editing`**, **`updating`**, and **`deleting`** entries.
- [X] Create appropriate `entries templates` for all entries views.
- [X] Add `search form` for searching for available entries.
- [X] Add `error page` when user search for unavailable entries.
- [X] Flash message to user when creating entries that are already available. (*duplicate entry)*.

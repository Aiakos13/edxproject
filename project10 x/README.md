# Description:
***PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT***

 Aiakos WordBeater is a Typing Challenge Game created to help students improve their typing speed. The game allows students to choose their own speed level and progress to more difficult levels as they improve. It also helps students become familiar with words and their spellings.

# CSS Directory:
## This directory contains all the stylesheets for the app. The base.css file provides the fundamental style for the app, while the game.css file is specifically for the game.html file.

# JS Directory:
## This directory includes four main files:

counter.js: This file defines functions that are used in other files.
level.js: This file defines functions for selecting the level and passes the selected level to core.js for processing.
words.js: This file contains an array of words that are used by core.js for typing challenges.
core.js: This file defines the core functionalities of the project. It accepts data from level.js, fetches words from words.js, and randomly displays them for typing. It also handles timing, scoring, and other functionalities.
# Removed Tricks:
## The word input field no longer accepts pasted contents.
The active word to be typed cannot be selected or copied.
Other tricks are yet to be discovered and resolved. Suggestions and feedback are welcome.
# TODO:
The functionalities of this app do not end here! We plan to implement a LEADERBOARD feature. The leaderboard will show how users are improving and challenging themselves. Users will be scored in WPM (Words Per Minute), which will motivate others to improve their typing skills.
